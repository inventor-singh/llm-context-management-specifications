# LLM Context Window Management Research & Specification

This repository contains comprehensive research on Large Language Model (LLM) context window management techniques, existing approaches, and the development of a standardized specification.

## Repository Structure

- [`research/`](./research/) - Research findings and analysis
- [`specifications/`](./specifications/) - Proposed specifications and standards
- [`examples/`](./examples/) - Implementation examples and use cases
- [`tools/`](./tools/) - Tools and utilities for context management

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to research existing approaches to LLM context window management and, if no comprehensive specification exists, develop one that addresses the universal challenges of:

1. **Context Window Limitations**: Managing the finite context window of LLMs
2. **Memory Management**: Strategies for long-term and short-term memory
3. **Context Compression**: Techniques for compressing and prioritizing context
4. **Context Retrieval**: Methods for retrieving relevant context when needed
5. **Context Segmentation**: Approaches to breaking down large contexts
6. **Context Coherence**: Maintaining coherence across context boundaries

## Current Status

üîç **Research Phase**: Analyzing existing literature and techniques

## Getting Started

1. Review the [research findings](./research/existing-approaches.md)
2. Examine [current techniques](./research/current-techniques.md)
3. Check out the [proposed specification](./specifications/llm-context-management-spec.md)

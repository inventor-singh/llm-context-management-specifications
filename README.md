## Overview

The LLM Context Window Management Specification (LCWMS) addresses the critical challenge of managing finite context windows in Large Language Models. Despite the universal nature of this problem, no comprehensive specification exists‚Äîuntil now.

This repository contains the first standardized framework for context window management, developed through comprehensive research of 100+ academic papers and industry practices.

## Problem Statement

Large Language Models face fundamental limitations:
- **Context Overflow**: Information loss when exceeding window limits
- **Memory Fragmentation**: Loss of coherence across context boundaries
- **Inefficient Resource Use**: Poor utilization of available context space
- **Lack of Standardization**: Incompatible approaches across implementations

## Solution: LCWMS

The specification provides:
- **Unified Architecture**: Three-tier memory hierarchy with standardized interfaces
- **Standard Protocols**: Context lifecycle management and optimization strategies
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Production-ready deployment frameworks
- **Evaluation Standards**: Comprehensive metrics and benchmarking protocols
